   Provides Worker and Display classes.
    
   NumberList holds a sequence of numbers, and defines several statistical
   operations (mean, stdev, etc.) FrequencyDistribution holds a mapping from
   items (not necessarily numbers) to counts, and defines operations such as
   Shannon entropy and frequency normalization.

             The Display object is the main interface to TKInter display.                                  
             Basically it is a simple Canvas with a frame inside a window.                                 
                                                                                                           
             Data processed by workers are displayed inside the canvas.                                    
                                                                                                           
               Methods defined here:                                                                       
                                                                                                           
               __init__(self, size, max_ants)                                                              
                  size: The display size. Should be equal to config.PLAYGROUND_SIZE                        
                  max_ants: The estimated maximum number of ants                                           
                                                                                                           
                  Since the number of living ants can not be guessed or guaranted, the max_ants            
                  is an estimation.                                                                        
                  It's a good idea to make it equal to config.FARM_INITIAL_FOOD_STOCK.                     
                                                                                                           
                  The max_ants value will determine the number of workers created by the Display object.

                  (or fractions thereof). As join() always returns None, you must call                     
                  isAlive() after join() to decide whether a timeout happened -- if the                    
                  thread is still alive, the join() call timed out.                                        
                                                                                                           
                  When the timeout argument is not present or None, the operation will                     
                  block until the thread terminates.
