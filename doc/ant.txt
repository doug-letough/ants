                  For each new record, the history is recreated in a way that the shortest path                                  
                  from the oldest position to the current position is retained.                                                  
                  Still, the new shortest path will only use position wihin the history.                                         
                  The shortest path from within the history is rarely (who said never ?) the shortest path on the play ground.

                  A new position is randomly generated by adding -1, 0 or 1 to one of

                  adjusted. Thus an ant can not walk out of the play ground which is finite.

                  Swap history and path to go.                                                                                   
                  When an Ant find food, it needs to go back home.

                  Once the path to go is set, the actual history is wiped out.                                                   
                  Same process occurs when an Ant comes back to home with food, so it can go back to the Mine.
